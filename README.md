## Abstract
We present XROI-GS, an immersive XR framework enabling
real-time exploration and interaction with complex real-world scenes.
The system addresses the challenge of delivering photorealistic detail for
user-specied objects within large-scale scenes while maintaining real-
time XR performance. Our demonstration showcases a cultural heritage
scene from the Hôtel de la Marine museum, where users can freely ex-
plore the scene space and naturally interact with historical artifacts using
controller-free virtual hands. Our contribution is an automatic mecha-
nism that signicantly improves the visual quality of objects: when a
user approaches or interacts with an artifact, the system enhances its
resolution to increase rendering quality. In addition, we provide physi-
cally based manipulation for realistic and intuitive object handling. This
framework democratizes access to fragile cultural treasures by enabling
close inspection and interaction impossible in traditional museum set-
tings, opening new possibilities for digital heritage preservation and pub-
lic engagement.
